Hello, I am Ehiz Daniel, a Data Science and and Machine Learning enthusiast. I am currently starting a career in Data Science. Getting my hands around data and findling with it makes me happy and occupied, hence the neccesity to follow my line of affection.
I hope to solve problems on decision making and prediction and I am looking to collaborate on any project that involves using data to predict events and likelihoods.
